# Branch Progress Summary: lua-xml-runtime-hooks

## 🎯 **CURRENT CRITICAL BUG**
**Status: ACTIVE CRASH** - Game crashes in mod menu due to hooks being installed when they should be disabled.

**Root Cause:** Database check overrides MOD_BIN_HOOKS macro
- `MOD_BIN_HOOKS = false` (correct - hooks should be disabled in mod menu)
- `Direct database check: BIN_HOOKS = true` (incorrect - stale database data)
- Result: Hooks installed anyway, intercept legitimate mod loading, game crashes

**Fix Needed:** Remove database check, trust MOD_BIN_HOOKS macro only.

## 📈 **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS ACHIEVED**

### ✅ **1. Address Calculation System (WORKING)**
- **Problem:** Hardcoded addresses failed due to ASLR
- **Solution:** Runtime base address + offset calculation
- **Status:** ✅ WORKING - Base address 0x00520000 detected correctly
- **Commit:** 1332e3f0c, cc7bfc9c6

### ✅ **2. Hook Installation System (WORKING)**
- **Problem:** Compilation errors, function declarations
- **Solution:** Fixed C++/SEH conflicts, proper member functions
- **Status:** ✅ WORKING - All 6 hooks install successfully
- **Commit:** 78f751f67, 552d08b2d

### ✅ **3. Hook Execution System (WORKING)**
- **Problem:** Hooks not being called
- **Solution:** Proper function prologue detection and hooking
- **Status:** ✅ WORKING - Hooks execute and intercept calls
- **Evidence:** HOOK_EXECUTION_DEBUG.txt shows "Individual mod disable function intercepted!"

### ✅ **4. Timing Strategy (CORRECT)**
- **Problem:** Delayed installation missed early MP setup
- **Solution:** Early installation during DLL constructor
- **Status:** ✅ CORRECT - Hooks installed at right time
- **Key Insight:** Commit b42e7a66f proved hooks MUST be in constructor

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL SYSTEMS STATUS**

### **Hook Types Implemented:**
1. **Individual Mod Disable Hooks** (3x: DX9, DX11, Tablet) ✅ WORKING
2. **Bulk Mod Deactivation Hooks** (3x: DX9, DX11, Tablet) ✅ WORKING  
3. **SQLite Database Hooks** (sqlite3_exec, sqlite3_prepare) ✅ WORKING

### **Address Calculation:**
```cpp
DWORD baseAddress = (DWORD)GetModuleHandleA(NULL);  // Runtime base
DWORD targetAddress = baseAddress + offset;         // ASLR-safe
```
**Status:** ✅ WORKING - Handles ASLR correctly

### **Hook Installation Method:**
```cpp
// 1. VirtualProtect to make memory writable
// 2. Install JMP instruction to hook function  
// 3. Hook function uses context-aware logic
```
**Status:** ✅ WORKING - All hooks install successfully

### **Context-Aware Hook Logic:**
```cpp
// During startup (game state not accessible): return success
// During multiplayer: block mod deactivation  
// During single player: return success
```
**Status:** ✅ WORKING - Prevents crashes, blocks MP deactivation

## 🐛 **BUGS FIXED**

1. **getGameINLINE() doesn't exist** → Fixed: Use GC.getGamePointer()
2. **DWORD format specifier warnings** → Fixed: %08X → %08lX  
3. **Hardcoded addresses fail with ASLR** → Fixed: Runtime base + offset
4. **C++/SEH __try conflicts** → Fixed: Use IsBadReadPtr instead
5. **Function declaration errors** → Fixed: Proper member function declarations
6. **Compilation brace structure** → Fixed: Proper C++ syntax
7. **Startup crashes from hooks** → Fixed: Context-aware hook logic

---

## 🎮 **TESTING RESULTS**

### **Latest Test (Commit 552d08b2d):**
- **at-modmenu**: ❌ CRASH - Hooks installed when MOD_BIN_HOOKS=false
- **at-stagingroom**: ⏳ NOT TESTED (need to fix mod menu crash first)

### **Previous Successful Tests:**
- **Address calculation**: ✅ Base 0x00520000 detected
- **Hook installation**: ✅ All 6 hooks install successfully  
- **Hook execution**: ✅ Functions intercepted correctly
- **Compilation**: ✅ No build errors

## 🔄 **EVOLUTION OF APPROACHES**

### **Phase 1: Function Discovery**
- Started with Lua-exposed DisableMod functions
- Discovered these aren't called during MP setup
- Found bulk deactivation functions instead

### **Phase 2: Address Handling** 
- Started with hardcoded addresses (failed due to ASLR)
- Evolved to runtime base address calculation (working)

### **Phase 3: Crash Prevention**
- Started with delayed installation (wrong - missed MP setup)
- Evolved to early installation + context-aware hooks (correct)

### **Phase 4: Current Bug**
- Database check overriding MOD_BIN_HOOKS macro
- Need to trust macro only, ignore database

---

## 🎯 **NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION**

**Fix the database override bug:**
```cpp
// REMOVE this database check logic:
if (db->SelectWhere(kResults, "CustomModOptions", "Name='BIN_HOOKS'")) {
    binHooksEnabled = (kResults.GetInt("Value") == 1);
}

// KEEP only this:
binHooksEnabled = MOD_BIN_HOOKS;
```

**Expected Result:** 
- at-modmenu: MOD_BIN_HOOKS=false → No hooks → No crash
- at-stagingroom: MOD_BIN_HOOKS=true → Hooks installed → MP protection

## 📚 **KEY LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **Timing is Critical:** Hooks MUST be in DLL constructor for MP setup
2. **ASLR Requires Runtime Calculation:** Never use hardcoded addresses
3. **Context-Aware Hooks Prevent Crashes:** Check game state before blocking
4. **Database Can Have Stale Data:** Trust runtime flags over database
5. **Early Installation + Smart Logic:** Better than delayed installation
