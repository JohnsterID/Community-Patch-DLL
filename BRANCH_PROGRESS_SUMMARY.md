# Branch Progress Summary: lua-xml-runtime-hooks

## üö® **CURRENT CRITICAL STATUS - COMPREHENSIVE DLL LIFECYCLE DEBUGGING DEPLOYED**
**Status: ENHANCED DEBUGGING** - Comprehensive debugging system deployed to investigate infinite constructor loop

**Major Breakthrough:** Hook approach is NOT fundamentally flawed
- **Baseline test completed** - Infinite constructor loop occurs EVEN WITH HOOKS COMPLETELY DISABLED
- **Root cause identified** - DLL lifecycle issue during SP‚ÜíMP transition, NOT hook execution
- **Timeline confirmed** - Loop starts at ~38 seconds during multiplayer setup phase
- **Evidence gathered** - Same instance called 64+ times rapidly without any hook interference

**Current Status:** Enhanced debugging system deployed (commit 7574d2ed1)
**Next Step:** Analyze comprehensive DLL lifecycle logs to identify reload trigger

## üîç **ACTUAL MOD DEACTIVATION TIMING (From Analysis)**

Based on reverse-engineered code analysis from **Civ5XP.c** (Linux binary with most detailed information):

**The Real Timeline:**
1. **0s**: `HostLANGame()` completes, mods still active
2. **~12s**: Network establishes, `GameLaunched` callback fires  
3. **~12s**: `NetInitGame::Execute()` triggers game initialization
4. **~12s**: `CvModdingFrameworkAppSide::SetActiveDLCandMods()` called
5. **~12s**: `Modding::System::DeactivateMods()` executes `BEGIN; UPDATE Mods Set Activated = 0; END;`

**Key Functions Discovered:**
- **Linux:** `Modding::System::DeactivateMods` at `08C6F95A`
- **DX9:** `sub_7B91F0` at `0x007B91F0`  (our hook target)
- **DX11:** `sub_7C1BB0` at `0x007C1BB0`
- **Tablet:** `sub_7C2C60` at `0x007C2C60`

**Research Method:** Check **Civ5XP.c** first (most detailed), then map to Windows binaries

## üìà **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS ACHIEVED**

### ‚úÖ **1. Address Calculation System (WORKING)**
- **Problem:** Hardcoded addresses failed due to ASLR
- **Solution:** Runtime base address + offset calculation
- **Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Base address 0x00520000 detected correctly
- **Commit:** 1332e3f0c, cc7bfc9c6

### ‚úÖ **2. Hook Installation System (WORKING)**
- **Problem:** Compilation errors, function declarations
- **Solution:** Fixed C++/SEH conflicts, proper member functions
- **Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - All 6 hooks install successfully
- **Commit:** 78f751f67, 552d08b2d

### ‚úÖ **3. Hook Execution System (WORKING)**
- **Problem:** Hooks not being called
- **Solution:** Proper function prologue detection and hooking
- **Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Hooks execute and intercept calls
- **Evidence:** HOOK_EXECUTION_DEBUG.txt shows "Individual mod disable function intercepted!"

### ‚úÖ **4. Timing Strategy (CORRECT)**
- **Problem:** Delayed installation missed early MP setup
- **Solution:** Early installation during DLL constructor
- **Status:** ‚úÖ CORRECT - Hooks installed at right time
- **Key Insight:** Commit b42e7a66f proved hooks MUST be in constructor

### ‚úÖ **5. Database Override Bug (FIXED)**
- **Problem:** Database check overrode MOD_BIN_HOOKS macro with stale data
- **Solution:** Trust MOD_BIN_HOOKS macro only, ignore database
- **Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Commit 97f2dc8a2
- **Expected:** No more crashes in mod menu

### ‚úÖ **6. Infinite Recursion Bug (FIXED)**
- **Problem:** Calling `g_originalBulkDeactivate(this_ptr)` creates infinite recursion
- **Root Cause:** Hook installation overwrites original function with JMP to our hook
- **Solution:** Don't call original function at all - return success without SQL execution
- **Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Commit dbf144ff8
- **Evidence:** 36,582 hook executions reduced to single execution

### ‚ùå **7. Hook Execution Triggers Infinite Constructor Loop (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem:** Hook execution itself causes infinite constructor/destructor loop
- **Root Cause:** Blocking deactivation SQL causes game state inconsistency
- **Discovery:** Game expects deactivation to succeed as part of larger process
- **Status:** ‚ùå CRITICAL - Hook approach fundamentally flawed
- **Evidence:** Infinite destructor loop starts immediately after successful hook execution

### üî¨ **8. Enhanced DLL Lifecycle Debugging System (IMPLEMENTED)**
- **Problem:** Infinite constructor loop occurs even with hooks completely disabled
- **Solution:** Comprehensive DLL lifecycle debugging to identify root cause
- **Status:** ‚úÖ ENHANCED - Commit 7574d2ed1
- **Features:** 
  - **DLL Lifecycle Tracking:** DllMain ATTACH/DETACH cycles with timestamps
  - **Constructor Analysis:** Memory usage, rapid call detection, module tracking
  - **Game State Monitoring:** SP‚ÜíMP transitions, multiplayer state changes
  - **Instance Tracking:** DLL instance changes, call frequency analysis
  - **Process Debugging:** Memory counters, module handles, thread information

DWORD baseAddress = (DWORD)GetModuleHandleA(NULL);  // Runtime base
DWORD targetAddress = baseAddress + offset;         // ASLR-safe
```
**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Handles ASLR correctly

### **Hook Installation Method:**
```cpp
// 1. VirtualProtect to make memory writable
// 2. Install JMP instruction to hook function  
// 3. Hook function uses context-aware logic

## üîÑ **EVOLUTION OF APPROACHES**

### **Phase 1: Function Discovery**
- Started with Lua-exposed DisableMod functions
- Discovered these aren't called during MP setup
- Found bulk deactivation functions instead

### **Phase 2: Address Handling** 
- Started with hardcoded addresses (failed due to ASLR)
- Evolved to runtime base address calculation (working)

### **Phase 3: Crash Prevention**
- Started with delayed installation (wrong - missed MP setup)
- Evolved to early installation + context-aware hooks (correct)

### **Phase 4: Database Override Bug**
- Database check overriding MOD_BIN_HOOKS macro (fixed)
- Now trusts macro only, ignores database

### **Phase 5: Infinite Recursion Bug**
- Calling `g_originalBulkDeactivate(this_ptr)` created infinite loop (fixed)
- Hook installation overwrites original function with JMP to our hook
- Solution: Don't call original function at all, return success directly

### **Phase 6: Hook Execution Triggers Constructor Loop**
- Infinite recursion fixed, but hook execution itself causes crash
- Blocking deactivation SQL causes game state inconsistency
- Game expects deactivation to succeed as part of larger process
- Current approach: Hooks completely disabled to establish baseline

## üéØ **NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **1. Analyze Enhanced DLL Lifecycle Logs (CRITICAL):**
- Test at-stagingroom with enhanced debugging system (commit 7574d2ed1)
- Analyze comprehensive logs: DLL_LIFECYCLE_DEBUG.txt, CONSTRUCTOR_STACK_TRACE.txt, ADVANCED_DEBUG_ANALYSIS.txt
- Identify what triggers DLL reload cycles during SP‚ÜíMP transition

### **2. Correlate Debugging Data:**
- Match DLL ATTACH/DETACH cycles with constructor calls
- Identify game state changes that trigger DLL reloads
- Analyze memory usage patterns during infinite loop
- Track timing correlation between state transitions and loops

### **3. Identify DLL Reload Root Cause:**
- Determine if multiple processes are involved
- Check if game is intentionally reloading DLL during MP setup
- Identify Windows API calls causing LoadLibrary/FreeLibrary cycles
- Find intervention point to prevent unnecessary reloads

### **4. Research Available Binaries:**
- **Primary:** `/workspace/Civ5XP.c` (Linux - most detailed information with names preserved)
- **Secondary:** `/workspace/CivilizationV.exe.c` (DX9)
- **Tertiary:** `/workspace/CivilizationV_Tablet.exe.c`, `/workspace/CivilizationV_DX11.exe.c` (DX11)

## üìö **KEY LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **Timing is Critical:** Hooks MUST be in DLL constructor for MP setup
2. **ASLR Requires Runtime Calculation:** Never use hardcoded addresses
3. **Context-Aware Hooks Prevent Crashes:** Check game state before blocking
4. **Database Can Have Stale Data:** Trust runtime flags over database
5. **Early Installation + Smart Logic:** Better than delayed installation
6. **Real Deactivation is During Game Init:** Not in staging room, but during NetInitGame::Execute()
7. **CRITICAL: Never Call Hooked Function from Hook:** Creates infinite recursion
8. **Hook Installation Overwrites Original:** `g_originalBulkDeactivate` points to hooked address
9. **Return Success Without Calling Original:** Prevents SQL execution and infinite loops
10. **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Hook Approach NOT Fundamentally Flawed:** Infinite constructor loop occurs even with hooks completely disabled
11. **Root Cause is DLL Lifecycle Issue:** SP‚ÜíMP transition triggers DLL reload cycles, not hook execution
12. **Comprehensive Debugging is Essential:** DLL lifecycle, constructor, and game state monitoring required
13. **Research Method:** Check Civ5XP.c first (most detailed), then map to Windows binaries
