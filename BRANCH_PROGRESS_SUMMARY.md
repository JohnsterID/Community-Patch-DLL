# Branch Progress Summary: lua-xml-runtime-hooks

## üö® **FINAL STATUS - HOOK-BASED APPROACH FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE**
**Status: COMPREHENSIVE FAILURE** - All hook-based approaches systematically fail due to architectural incompatibility

**Technical Achievement:** Hook installation and execution system is FULLY WORKING
- **Strategic installation successful** - Hooks install on first call regardless of MOD_BIN_HOOKS
- **No constructor recursion** - Multi-layer protection prevents infinite loops completely
- **Hook execution confirmed** - Successfully intercepted mod deactivation functions
- **All approaches tested** - Blocking, restoration, SQLite, threading - all implemented and tested

**Fundamental Problem:** Game's SP‚ÜíMP transition architecture is incompatible with mod preservation
- **Root cause:** SP‚ÜíMP transition is designed to deactivate mods as core game logic
- **State conflict:** Any interference with deactivation breaks game's expected state flow
- **Pattern confirmed:** Every approach fails at the same architectural level

**Final Conclusion:** Hook-based approach is fundamentally flawed and should be abandoned
**Recommendation:** Explore non-hook solutions (launcher modifications, config changes, external tools)

## üîç **ACTUAL MOD DEACTIVATION TIMING (From Analysis)**

Based on reverse-engineered code analysis from **Civ5XP.c** (Linux binary with most detailed information):

**The Real Timeline:**
1. **0s**: `HostLANGame()` completes, mods still active
2. **~12s**: Network establishes, `GameLaunched` callback fires  
3. **~12s**: `NetInitGame::Execute()` triggers game initialization
4. **~12s**: `CvModdingFrameworkAppSide::SetActiveDLCandMods()` called
5. **~12s**: `Modding::System::DeactivateMods()` executes `BEGIN; UPDATE Mods Set Activated = 0; END;`

**Key Functions Discovered:**
- **Linux:** `Modding::System::DeactivateMods` at `08C6F95A`
- **DX9:** `sub_7B91F0` at `0x007B91F0`  (our hook target)
- **DX11:** `sub_7C1BB0` at `0x007C1BB0`
- **Tablet:** `sub_7C2C60` at `0x007C2C60`

**Research Method:** Check **Civ5XP.c** first (most detailed), then map to Windows binaries

## üî¨ **REVERSE-ENGINEERED CODE ANALYSIS**

### **Available Binaries for Research:**
1. **`/workspace/Civ5XP.c`** (Linux binary - 2.3M lines)
   - **Most detailed information available**
   - Contains exact function names and signatures
   - Shows complete call sequences and SQL statements
   - **Primary research source**

2. **`/workspace/CivilizationV.exe.c`** (Windows DX9)
   - Our primary target platform
   - Legacy DirectX 9 version
   - Functions have generic names (sub_XXXXXX)

3. **`/workspace/CivilizationV_DX11.exe.c`** (Windows DX11)

4. **`/workspace/CivilizationV_Tablet.exe.c`** (Windows Tablet)
   - Alternative Windows platform
   - Similar structure to DX11 version

### **Key Function Mappings Discovered:**
| Platform | Function | Address | SQL Executed |
|----------|----------|---------|--------------|
| Linux | `Modding::System::DeactivateMods` | `08C6F95A` | `BEGIN; UPDATE Mods Set Activated = 0; END;` |

## üß™ **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED**

### **All Major Approaches Tested and Failed:**

#### **1. Blocking Deactivation Approaches:**
- **at-modmenu**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Database override bug fixed, no more crashes
- **at-stagingroom (Early Tests)**: ‚ùå Hook execution ‚Üí infinite constructor loop ‚Üí game state inconsistency crash
- **strategic-hook-installation**: ‚úÖ TECHNICAL SUCCESS + ‚ùå GAME LOGIC CRASH
  - **Hook installation**: ‚úÖ All 6 hooks installed successfully
  - **Hook execution**: ‚úÖ Intercepted deactivation functions correctly
  - **Mod protection**: ‚úÖ Successfully blocked deactivation attempts
  - **BUT: Game crashed** due to state inconsistency (game expects deactivation to succeed)

#### **2. Post-Deactivation Restoration Approaches:**
- **SQLite-based restoration (c44544a6a)**: ‚ùå SQLite hooks never executed - wrong interception point
- **Background thread restoration (c57de068f)**: ‚ùå Thread safety crashes during mod loading
- **Function-based restoration (5a958d1ac)**: ‚ùå Infinite recursion issues

#### **3. Hybrid and Alternative Approaches:**
- **hooks-completely-disabled**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Confirmed DLL lifecycle works without hooks
- **Delayed installation**: ‚ùå Missed critical timing window for MP setup
- **Context-aware hooks**: ‚ùå Still caused state inconsistency when executed

### **Pattern Confirmed Across All Tests:**
- ‚úÖ **Technical Implementation**: All hook systems work perfectly
- ‚ùå **Game Logic Compatibility**: Every approach breaks SP‚ÜíMP transition flow
- ‚ùå **Architectural Conflict**: Game design fundamentally incompatible with mod preservation

- **Hook execution**: ‚úÖ Functions intercepted correctly

## üîÑ **EVOLUTION OF APPROACHES**

### **Phase 1: Function Discovery**
- Started with Lua-exposed DisableMod functions
- Discovered these aren't called during MP setup
- Found bulk deactivation functions instead

### **Phase 2: Address Handling** 
- Started with hardcoded addresses (failed due to ASLR)
- Evolved to runtime base address calculation (working)

### **Phase 3: Crash Prevention**
- Started with delayed installation (wrong - missed MP setup)
- Evolved to early installation + context-aware hooks (correct)

### **Phase 4: Database Override Bug**
- Database check overriding MOD_BIN_HOOKS macro (fixed)
- Now trusts macro only, ignores database

### **Phase 5: Infinite Recursion Bug**
- Calling `g_originalBulkDeactivate(this_ptr)` created infinite loop (fixed)
- Hook installation overwrites original function with JMP to our hook
- Solution: Don't call original function at all, return success directly

### **Phase 6: Hook Execution Triggers Constructor Loop**
- Infinite recursion fixed, but hook execution itself causes crash
- Blocking deactivation SQL causes game state inconsistency
- Game expects deactivation to succeed as part of larger process
- Current approach: Hooks completely disabled to establish baseline

---

## üèÅ **FINAL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Hook-Based Approach: ABANDONED**
After comprehensive testing of all major approaches, the hook-based method is fundamentally incompatible with Civilization V's architecture. The SP‚ÜíMP transition is designed to deactivate mods as core game logic, and any interference breaks the game's expected state flow.

### **Alternative Solutions to Explore:**

#### **1. Launcher-Based Solutions:**
- Modify game launcher to preserve mod settings during MP setup
- External mod management tools that work outside the game process
- Custom launcher that bypasses standard SP‚ÜíMP transition

#### **2. Configuration File Modifications:**
- Direct manipulation of mod database files before/after MP setup
- Registry or config file hooks outside the DLL system
- File system monitoring and restoration approaches

#### **3. Game Process Modifications:**
- Memory patching at the executable level (not DLL level)
- Process injection techniques that don't rely on DLL hooks
- External process monitoring and intervention

#### **4. Network Protocol Modifications:**
- Intercept and modify network packets related to mod synchronization
- Custom multiplayer setup protocols that preserve mods
- Proxy or middleware solutions for MP communication

### **Technical Assets Preserved:**
- Complete hook installation and execution system (fully working)
- Comprehensive debugging and analysis framework
- Deep understanding of game's mod deactivation mechanisms
- Proven address calculation and ASLR handling methods

**These technical achievements can be repurposed for alternative approaches that don't interfere with the game's core state management.**

## üìö **KEY LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **Timing is Critical:** Hooks MUST be in DLL constructor for MP setup
2. **ASLR Requires Runtime Calculation:** Never use hardcoded addresses
3. **Context-Aware Hooks Prevent Crashes:** Check game state before blocking
4. **Database Can Have Stale Data:** Trust runtime flags over database
5. **Early Installation + Smart Logic:** Better than delayed installation
6. **Real Deactivation is During Game Init:** Not in staging room, but during NetInitGame::Execute()
7. **CRITICAL: Never Call Hooked Function from Hook:** Creates infinite recursion
8. **Hook Installation Overwrites Original:** `g_originalBulkDeactivate` points to hooked address
9. **Return Success Without Calling Original:** Prevents SQL execution and infinite loops
10. **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Hook Approach NOT Fundamentally Flawed:** Infinite constructor loop occurs even with hooks completely disabled
11. **Root Cause is DLL Lifecycle Issue:** SP‚ÜíMP transition triggers DLL reload cycles, not hook execution
12. **Comprehensive Debugging is Essential:** DLL lifecycle, constructor, and game state monitoring required
13. **Research Method:** Check Civ5XP.c first (most detailed), then map to Windows binaries
